Vietnamese Food Detection & Calorie Calculation

- Overview

This project presents a real-time Vietnamese food detection and calorie calculation system. Given an image of a dish, the system automatically identifies which Vietnamese dish it is, retrieves the ingredient breakdown, and provides a calorie estimate.

We currently support 5 popular Vietnamese dishes:

Phở
Bánh mì
Bánh xèo
Cơm tấm
Gỏi cuốn

- Features

Real-time food detection using deep learning
Calorie estimation using an ingredients database
Combines deep learning and classical computer vision
Lightweight model optimized for practical use
Trained on over 5000 images
🧠 Methodology

We followed a multi-stage approach:

1. Traditional Feature-Based Methods
Color Histograms in HSV color space
SIFT descriptors
Combined features fed to ML classifiers
Result: <20% accuracy — insufficient for real-world use
2. Custom CNN
Trained from scratch
Achieved ~80% training accuracy, but severe overfitting
Validation accuracy ~30%
3. Transfer Learning
EfficientNetV2: High accuracy on test set (~90%), but overfitted to controlled data
MobileNetV2: Lower training accuracy (~60%) but better generalization in real-time use
4. Fusion-Based Final Model
Extracted deep embeddings from fine-tuned MobileNetV2
Fused with Color Histogram + SIFT features
Trained Random Forest classifier on fused features
Result: Real-world accuracy > 89%
